   abstract = {The large amount of data available in social media, forums and websites motivates researches in several areas of Natural Language Processing, such as sentiment analysis. The popularity of the area due to its subjective and semantic characteristics motivates research on novel methods and approaches for classification. Hence, there is a high demand for datasets on different domains and different languages. This paper introduces TweetSentBR, a sentiment corpus for Brazilian Portuguese manually annotated with 15.000 sentences on TV show domain. The sentences were labeled in three classes (positive, neutral and negative) by seven annotators, following literature guidelines for ensuring reliability on the annotation. We also ran baseline experiments on polarity classification using six machine learning classifiers, reaching 80.38\% on F-Measure in binary classification and 64.87\% when including the neutral class. We also performed experiments in similar datasets for polarity classification task in comparison to this corpus.},

In the case of Brazilian Portuguese, the number of papers is smaller because there are not so many datasets available and methods to perform the analysis. This work presents a methodology to compare techniques that classify feelings expressed directly or indirectly in tweets in the Brazilian Portuguese language. In addition, seven classes of feelings are considered and identified in the tweets. The results are promising when classifying distinct feelings, as the best classifier achieves 85\% of accuracy. On the other hand, relations between close feelings present results less than 70\% of accuracy. Resumo. Existem diversos trabalhos sobre análise de sentimentos para a língua inglesa.

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly , using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

   abstract = {The proliferation of social media in the recent past has provided end users a powerful platform to voice their opinions. Businesses (or similar entities) need to identify the polarity of these opinions in order to understand user orientation and thereby make smarter decisions. One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance. Finally, we propose a scalable machine learning model to predict the election results using our two stage framework.},

Twitter-based data by itself is not necessarily a representative sample of the society due to non-uniform participation. This fact should be noticed when predicting real-world events from social media trends. Moreover, each tweet may bare a positive or negative sentiment towards the subject, which needs to be taken into account. By gathering a large dataset of more than 370,000 tweets on 2016 US Elections and carefully validating the resulting key trends against Google Trends, a legitimate dataset is created. A Gaussian process regression model is used to predict the election outcome; we bring in the novel idea of estimating candidates' vote shares instead of directly anticipating the winner of the election, as practiced in other approaches. Applying this method to the US 2016 Elections resulted in predicting Clinton's majority in the popular vote at the beginning of the elections week with 1\% error. The high variance in Trump supporters' behavior reported elsewhere is reflected in the higher error rate of his vote share.},

Second, we performed automatic buzzer detection on our Twitter data to remove those tweets generated by computer bots, paid users, and fanatic users that usually become noise in our data. Third, we performed a fine-grained political sentiment analysis to partition each tweet into several sub-tweets and subsequently assigned each sub-tweet with one of the candidates and its sentiment polarity. Finally, to predict the election results, we leveraged the number of positive sub-tweets for each candidate. Our experiment shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) of our Twitter-based prediction is 0.61\%, which is surprisingly better than the prediction results published by several independent survey institutions (offline polls). Our study suggests that Twitter can serve as an important resource for any political activity, specifically for predicting the final outcomes of the election itself.},

   abstract = {The proliferation of user-generated content on social media has made opinion mining an arduous job. As a microblogging platform, Twitter is being used to collect views about products, trends, and politics. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to analyze the attitude, emotions and opinions of different people towards anything, and it can be carried out on tweets to analyze public opinion on news, policies, social movements, and personalities. By employing Machine Learning models, opinion mining can be performed without reading tweets manually. Their results could assist governments and businesses in rolling out policies, products, and events. Seven Machine Learning models are implemented for emotion recognition by classifying tweets as happy or unhappy. With an in-depth comparative performance analysis, it was observed that proposed voting classifier(LR-SGD) with TF-IDF produces the most optimal result with 79\% accuracy and 81\% F1 score. To further validate stability of the proposed approach on two more datasets, one binary and other multi-class dataset and achieved robust results.},

@report{Tumasjan2010,
   abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging website where users read and write millions of short messages on a variety of topics every day. This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians' political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.},

   abstract = {Sentiment analysis deals with identifying and understanding opinions and sentiments expressed in a particular text. The masses give their opinion regarding various subjects on social media platforms using tweets, status updates and blogs. By analyzing this very data, we can gain better insight of the public opinion on any subject in specific. On performing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters allowed in Twitter is 140. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about government issues and political reforms. The proposed framework uses Twitter as the platform to analyze the emotions of the users using Sentiment Analysis. The system will use the opinions of the users, analyze the reaction and then map it to the appropriate region.},

The authors use tweets from President Candidates of Indonesia (Jokowi and Prabowo), and tweets from relevant hashtags for sentiment analysis gathered from March to July 2018 to predict Indonesian Presidential election result. The authors make an algorithm and method to count important data, top words and train the model and predict the polarity of the sentiment. The experimental result is produced by using R language and show that Jokowi leads the current election prediction. This prediction result is corresponding to four survey institutes in Indonesia that proved our method had produced reliable prediction results.},
